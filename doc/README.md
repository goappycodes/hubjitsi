# Documentation

This document is the entrypoint to different guides, divided in three groups:

* User guide: these documents are designed to help users of the service, to better
understand all the available features and how to use them.

* Developer guide: these documents are designed to help developers who want to either
integrate the Jitsi Meet API / SDK in their products or want to improve Jitsi Meet
itself by developing new features or fixing bugs.

* DevOps guide: these documents are designed for DevOps folks, system administrators
or anyone who wishes to deploy and operate their own Jitsi Meet instance.
